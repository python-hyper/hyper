HTTP is changing under our feet. HTTP/1.1, our old friend, is being
supplemented by the brand new HTTP/2 standard. HTTP/2 provides many benefits:
improved speed, lower bandwidth usage, better connection management, and more.

``hyper`` provides these benefits to your Python code. How? Like this::

    from hyper import HTTPConnection

    conn = HTTPConnection('nghttp2.org:443')
    conn.request('GET', '/httpbin/get')
    resp = conn.get_response()

    print(resp.read())

Simple.

Caveat Emptor!
==============

Please be warned: ``hyper`` is in a very early alpha. You *will* encounter bugs
when using it. In addition, there are very many rough edges. With that said,
please try it out in your applications: I need your feedback to fix the bugs
and file down the rough edges.

Versions
========

``hyper`` supports the final draft of the HTTP/2 specification: additionally,
it provides support for drafts 14, 15, and 16 of the HTTP/2 specification. It
also supports the final draft of the HPACK specification.

Compatibility
=============

``hyper`` is intended to be a drop-in replacement for ``http.client``, with a
similar API. However, ``hyper`` intentionally does not name its classes the
same way ``http.client`` does. This is because most servers do not support
HTTP/2 at this time: I don't want you accidentally using ``hyper`` when you
wanted ``http.client``.
