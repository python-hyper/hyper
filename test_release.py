~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function contains the release tests for `hyper`. These tests rely on
third-party implementations of HTTP/2 servers, and so are not usually run as
part of our regression tests. They are instead run before releasing `hyper`
as a sanity check to confirm that the library itself appears to function and is
capable of achieving basic tasks.
